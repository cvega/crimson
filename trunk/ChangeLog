	* Created new version 1.1.2beta2 of Crimson.  This version fixes
	bugs in previous releases such as version 1.1.1 and 1.1.  It was
	named 1.1.2beta2 because it is the same code that went into J2SE
	1.4 beta2 (also called beta refresh).  Despite the "beta2" name,
	this version is just as stable as the previous version 1.1.1 and
	should be preferred over version 1.1.1 because it has additional
	bug fixes.

	* This version obtains java src files including DOM Level 2 core
	and SAX2 from the new xml-commons module which should be checked
	out as a sibling of this tree to create a valid distribution.

	* This version packages all classes, both implementation and JAXP
	XML API classes into a single crimson.jar file.
