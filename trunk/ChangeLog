	* Created new version 1.1.2beta2 of Crimson.  This version fixes
	bugs in previous releases such as version 1.1.1 and 1.1.  It was
	named 1.1.2beta2 because it is the same code that went into J2SE
	1.4 beta2 (also called beta refresh).  Despite the "beta2" name,
	this version is just as stable as the previous version 1.1.1 and
	should be preferred over version 1.1.1 because it has additional
	bug fixes.

	* This version compiles JAXP src files including DOM L2 core and
	SAX2 from the new xml-commons module which should be checked out
	as a sibling of this tree.  The same jaxp.jar and crimson.jar
	files containing the same packages are built.  Later, we may just
	have a single crimson.jar that contains everything.

        * Populated the repository with the latest crimson sources.  The
          build system still needs to be updated and fixed up though.
