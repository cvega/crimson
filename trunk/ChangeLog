	* Created new version 1.1.2beta2 of Crimson.  This version fixes
	bugs in previous releases such as version 1.1.1 and 1.1.  It was
	named 1.1.2beta2 because it is the same code that went into J2SE
	1.4 beta2 (also called beta refresh).  Despite the "beta2" name,
	this version is just as stable as the previous version 1.1.1.

	* This version also uses the new common XML API jar file to contain
	the JAXP API and removes the DOM and SAX classes from crimson.jar.
	To use this package, place both xml-apis.jar and crimson.jar in
	your classpath.

        * Populated the repository with the latest crimson sources.  The
          build system still needs to be updated and fixed up though.
